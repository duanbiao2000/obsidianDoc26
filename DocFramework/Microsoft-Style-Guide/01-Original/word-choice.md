# Word choice

To improve readability and comprehension, choose your words wisely and use them consistently. If you mean the same thing, use the same word.

This section provides tips for choosing the right words for the job:

- Use contractions
- Use simple words, concise sentences
- Don't use common words in new ways
- Use technical terms carefully
- Avoid jargon
- Use US spelling and avoid non-English words

For information about specific words and phrases, refer to the A–Z word list and _Merriam-Webster Dictionary_.
